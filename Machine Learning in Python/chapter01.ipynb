    "# Chapter 1: The Two Essential Algorithms for Making Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 useful algorithms:\n",
    "1. Penalized linear regression (Logistic regression is a close relative)\n",
    "2. Ensemble methods (boosted decision trees, Random Forests, bagged decision trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide <u>optimum or near optimum</u> performance on the vast majority of predictive analytics (function approximation) problems. including <u>big data sets, little data sets, wide data sets, tall skinny data sets, complicated problems, and simple problems</u>\n",
    "- Attributes that <span style='color:blue'>relate directly</span> to the outcomes being predicted are a blessing\n",
    "- Attributes that are unrelated to the outcomes are a curse\n",
    "- An important benefit of the penalized linear regression models that the book covers is the **speed** at which they train\n",
    "- Feature selection or feature engineering: chooses the variables that will be used to predict outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Penalized Regression Methods\n",
    "- Penalized linear regression is a derivative of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression\n",
    "- OLS sometimes overfits the problem\n",
    "- When the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of points, the predictions are not very good\n",
    "- Penalized linear regression provides a way to systematically reduce degrees of freedom to match the amount of data available and the complexity of the underlying phenomena\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Methods\n",
    "- The basic idea with ensemble methods is to build a group of different predictive models and then combine their outputs by averaging the outputs or taking the majority answer\n",
    "- The individual models are called base learners\n",
    "- **Bagging** (short for bootstrap aggregating): One way to get differing models is to take random samples of the training data and train on these random subsets"
